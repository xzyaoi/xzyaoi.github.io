CVTron is a Computer Vision Library for industry use. It tries to provide an out-of-the-box experience for our customers and help them build on top of commonly used algorithms and models.

Currently in the first version of the CV Tron, it provides image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection services in the box. Users could use it for either training on their own datasets, or use some kind of out-of-the-box models such as VGG net and Inception.

CVTron also provides both web ui and cli tool for rapid deployment and local tests.
