collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-03-01-CVTron
excerpt: 'Recently, computer vision has aroused the greatest interest. Many companies have developed online inference system in the field of computer vision associated with web services, however, it still lacks easy-to-use online training system. This paper introduces CVTron Web system, an open source framework that serves as a web-based system and a dashboard for handling the training task, testing the inference, and checking hardware capabilities. By clicking on the web dashboard, developers or those having little programming knowledge will be able to complete several computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation for both training and inference.'
