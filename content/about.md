## Xiaozhe Yao (姚晓哲)

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

Xiaozhe Yao is a master's student majoring in Data Science at the University of Zurich. With interests spanning from machine learning systems to self-learning databases, his long-term goal is to make machine learning automatic and accessible.

Prior to University of Zurich, Xiaozhe Yao gained his Bachelor’s degree at Shenzhen University in Computer Science. He interned at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology in 2016 where he investigated recommendation systems for food nutrition data. Since then, he has been working on machine learning and computer vision systems aiming to reduce the barriers to applying algorithms.

In the past few years, he has been working on IndustryAI and CVTron, the end-to-end toolkit for computer vision. He witnessed the difficulties encountered while applying machine learning and grew his motivation to tackle these challenges in the entire machine learning pipeline management.

He is currently working on the project AID as an Innovator Fellow at ETH Zurich Library Lab. The objective of AID is to support the application of machine learning algorithms by imitating a library. It provides a digital library for searching, filtering and inspecting machine learning models. It also enables developers to easily install and run machine learning algorithms within a few unified steps.

Outside of the current project, he is also interested in machine learning in database systems.
