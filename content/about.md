## Xiaozhe Yao (姚晓哲)

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

Xiaozhe Yao is a second-year doctoral student at [Systems Group](https://systems.ethz.ch/), [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch) advised by [Prof. Dr. Ana Klimović](https://anakli.inf.ethz.ch/). With interests spanning from MLOps to Data-Centric Systems, his research direction is to democratize machine learning and make it accessible to a wider range of audience.

Prior to ETH Zurich, Xiaozhe Yao gained his Master's degree at the [University of Zurich](https://uzh.ch) in Data Science, advised by Prof. Dr. [Michael Böhlen](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/dbtg/Staff/Boehlen.html) and [Qing Chen](https://qingchen3.github.io/). Before that, he completed his Bachelor’s study at [Shenzhen University](https://szu.edu.cn) in Computer Science, advised by Prof. Dr. [Shiqi Yu](http://yushiqi.cn/). He interned at [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology](https://siat.ac.cn) in 2016 as a data scientist.

Between 2021 and 2022, he worked on the [project AID](https://aid.autoai.org) as an Innovator Fellow at the [Library Lab](https://www.librarylab.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich. The objective of AID is to support the application of machine learning algorithms by imitating a real library. It provides a unified programming interface to access and manage machine learning models, a digital library for searching, filtering and inspecting machine learning models.
